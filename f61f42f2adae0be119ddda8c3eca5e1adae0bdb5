VMI creation\n-\u003e collect vlan_id and PI\n-\u003e create placeholder VMI in DB\n-\u003e create VPG in DB\n2. VMI update (referring to a different VN, if that\u0027s the case)\n-\u003e collect vlan_id and PI\n-\u003e compare with old vlan_id and PI.uuid\n-\u003e delete old placeholder VMI and create a new one if vlan_id changed (I gave placeholder VMI uuid as \"_vmi_vlan_\" + vlan_id, as vlan_id in new VN might change, I simply delete the old one)\n-\u003e delete old VPG and create a new one (VPG uuid as \"vpg_\" + VN.uuid)\n3. VN update (non provider VN to provider VN)\n-\u003e follow the same as step 1",
